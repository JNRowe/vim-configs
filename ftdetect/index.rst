``ftdetect`` - filetype detection
=================================

The files under this directory are for filetype detection, including overrides
for personal preferences.  There shouldn’t be anything in here that would be
generic enough to be useful to upstream.

.. note::

    The files in this directory have :repo:`vint <Kuniwak/vint>`’s
    ``ProhibitAutocmdWithNoGroup`` check disabled as |vim| handles that in this
    instance.  See the help for :vimdoc:`ftdetect <filetype.txt#ftdetect>` for
    more information.
