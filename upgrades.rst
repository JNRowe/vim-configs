Pending changes
===============

This document lists the things that are coming down the |vim| pipeline that
interest me.  It should be noted that all of them already exist in released
patches, but they’re not available in the environments I use yet.  I keep this
file around to remind me of the things I’m missing out on, and what I need to
work on when I upgrade.

.. note::

    If this document is empty below this point, then purring kittens are riding
    unicorns over double rainbows.  You simply must look out the window right
    now!

.. todo::

    Add ``:tlmenu`` support to :doc:`localcfg/menu`, see 8.1.0487.
