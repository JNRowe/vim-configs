``vimrc.d`` - Main configuration files
======================================

With the notable exception of :repo:`dein.vim <Shougo/dein.vim>` configuration,
this directory is for configuring :command:`vim`â€™s built-in functionality.  The
``dein.vim`` configuration is here because it needs to be read before
:doc:`localcfg settings <../localcfg/index>` can be used.
