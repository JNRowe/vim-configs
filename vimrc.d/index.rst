``vimrc.d`` - Main configuration files
======================================

With the notable exception of ``dein`` configuration, this directory is for
configuring :command:`vim`â€™s built-in functionality.  The ``dein`` configuration
is here because it needs to be read before :doc:`localcfg settings
<../localcfg/index>` can be used.
