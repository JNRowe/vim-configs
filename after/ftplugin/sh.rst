``after/ftplugin/sh.vim``
=========================

Add on-hover command definitions::

    if has('gui_running')
        command! CommandBalloon
            \ setlocal balloonexpr=CommandBalloon('whatis')
    endif

.. note::

    This isnâ€™t the default as :ref:`ale <ale-plugin>` provides a nice general
    usage for balloons, however occasionally when dipping in to a shell script
    on an unususal system this can be useful.
