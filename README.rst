vim-configs
===========

This is just my personal vim_ configuration files that are shared
between hosts.  Maybe they're useful to you too, or better yet maybe
you'll spot *and* fix a bug!

If you find any problems with the configuration files in this repository
either drop me an email_ or file an issue_.  Locally, bugs are managed
with ditz_, so if you're working with a clone of the repository you can
report, list and fix bugs directly in the repository [#]_.

Installation
------------

Do not install these files!!  They'll likely break your current set up
and *may* even eat your dog.

.. [#] If you're using Gentoo_ you can find an ebuild for ditz_, in my
       overlay_.
