vim-configs
===========

.. note::

    This repository is in hibernation for various reasons, but if we work
    together you can find a current version under
    ``~JNRowe/silhouette/vim-configs``.  I hope to re-enable public pushes at
    some point, but it has close to the lowest priority on my entire todo list
    right now [2024-02-04].

This is my personal vim_ configuration that is shared among hosts.  Maybe
they’re useful to you too, or — better yet — you’ll spot *and* fix a bug!

It uses features introduced in version 8.2, but should work with later versions.
It will *not* work with neovim_, and that is unlikely to change in the near
future.

If you find any problems with the files in this repository either file an
issue_, or drop me a mail_.  However, please do not report problems when using
neovim_, pull requests are fine though.

Poke around in the ``.rst`` files to see how things work, and be forewarned that
it isn’t for the faint of heart!
