``localcfg/plugin_vim_fugitive.vim``
====================================

Add map to jump to ``git`` project root::

    nmap <silent> <C-p> :Gcd<CR>

.. note::

    I never use :kbd:`<C-p>` or :kbd:`<C-n>` for navigation, as :command:`vim`
    generally offers far more useful navigation, and anyway you can still move
    up with :kbd:`k`.
